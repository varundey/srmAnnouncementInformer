## Bonus :tada:
##### Coz who doesn't like some add-ons
The announcer.py file can be set under as a cron-job to be run at every minute/hour/boot. Alas the OSD of linux kernel and cronTab are set up under different environment, and thus we have to work our way around a bit. In order to create a cronjob for the python file, keep reading:
```
 chmod 700 srmAnnouncementInformer/bin/export_x_info
 sh srmAnnouncementInformer/bin/export_x_info
```
* Now open Dash and under Startup Applications, add the `export_x_info` script
* Under `crontab -e` add the following two lines in the begining
```
SHELL=/bin/bash
DISPLAY=:0.0
```
* Depending on your schedule and path, your crontab should look along the line of the following:
```
@reboot source ~/.Xdbus; python srmAnnouncementInformer/announcer.py
```

### Inspiration
This project was inspired from [Result-Reminder](https://github.com/Sandeeprds95/result-reminder) by [@Sandeeprds95](https://github.com/Sandeeprds95). Why not make a general announcement notifier. :smiley:
